# how to get started
> With Android Studio you should have this application up and running in no time. The only default settings altered
> were the minSdkVersion.  This was raised to 24 for reasons that escape me, but i can assure that is was important.
> My Gradle settings are included in the package, so please double check your compatibility before building
> (or just build and follow the recommended fix). If you are familiar with Android Studio, then these steps would come
> as no surprise. If not, don't fret.  Android Studio will cover the steps needed that i have missed.
