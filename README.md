# how to use
> The first couple challenges will quiz the users knowledge of which appropriate control signals
> are needed for each intruction set.  Hints are made available by clicking the "Control Unit" button.
> By completing preceeding challenges, the user can then move onto harder challenges. 
> The final challenge consists of objectives.  For these objectives the user is provided
> with a goal while being restricted in various way.  Whether by limited intruction access or by only
> using the supplied data, the user must create their own instruction set to complete the objective.

## features
* Three difficulty challenges
* Objective challenges (currently only 1, but more to come)
* Instruction encoding visualization

## afterword
> I'm not an artist so the artwork is a little rough.  And due to certain limitations with the current design
> the scaling for differing phone resolutions is satisfactory, but not ideal.  My hope is that future updates will
> address these issues.  Likewise, more objectives will be the longterm goal.  I even left implicit spots available
> for adding your own objectives.
