# how to get started
> With Android Studio you should have this application up and running in no time. The only default settings altered
> were the minSdkVersion.  This was raised to 24 for reasons that escape me, but i can assure that it was important.
> My Gradle settings are included in the package, so please double check your version before building.

> The steps for getting the project up and running are very simple. As you can see below, just loading the project
> in the order of the steps shown below resulted in an automatic build on my mobile workstation.
